## ITimeDependent: Not yet... ðŸ˜‰

## Source file: AdvancedBackground.cs

This extension provides you with nice looking sky (without clouds). The advanced background also implements ILightSource, it is needed for sun rendering. I tried to make all paramteres customizable. And I also provided default values that IMHO look good (or at least I tried to make them look good).

The list of customizable parameters will appear here (when the implementation is finalized):

## Examples &amp; sample scripts:

Examples will be provided when implementation is finalized.

`AdvancedBackground adv = new AdvancedBackground(new double[] {0.1, 0.2, 0.4}, new double[] {0.45, 0.55, 0.65}, new double[] {0.1, 0.05, 0.02}, Vector3d.UnitY);

scene.background = adv;

scene.Sources.Add(adv);`
